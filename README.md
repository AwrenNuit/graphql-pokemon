# GraphQL & React

## Description
I find that the way I learn best is by reading the docs, finding a brief overview tutorial, and then digging in on my own. To gain a better understanding of how GraphQL and Apollo work with React I followed [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-web-app-with-graphql-and-react/). Even though it's from December, which is only four months ago at time of writing, the query criteria (and possibly the dependencies) seemed to already be out of date. One quick search later all was well. Now to dive deeper into things.
