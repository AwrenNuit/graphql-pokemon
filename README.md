# GraphQL & React

## Description
I find that the way I learn best is by reading the docs, finding a brief overview tutorial, and then digging in on my own. To gain a better understanding of how GraphQL and Apollo work with React I followed [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-web-app-with-graphql-and-react/).
